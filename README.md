Paint is a program, created during Valparaiso CS-250 Object Oriented Programming,
that is meant to be a rendition of Microsoft Paint. The project is built through
(about) six weeks of self-driven work with new features being added every week. 
Each week we had to not only add new features to the Paint project, but also kept 
and updated Release Notes detailing the new features that were added to the program.
