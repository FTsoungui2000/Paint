Franck's Paint(t) Final Turn in 11/27/2023

Overall Notes
My finally thoughts on the Pain(t) project was that this was a very positive, although
ver stress full project. The week to week requirements started to get harder and harder,
which seems natural, but I do wish that the deadline for the later weeks were extended as
the requirements started getting harder. This is my first time living with my own code and
building on it for mulitple weeks and I found my self, at times, wishing that I had better
planned my project in advance because there did not go a week when I was not rewritting something
I had prevously done. Although seeing other peoples code made me more confident that my coding is 
somewhat neat, I do need to improve on commenting throughout the code to improve quality and reuse
ability.
