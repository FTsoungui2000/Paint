My project is in a mess. Code wise, I fill like I've done a good job splitting apart the different
parts of the code and I think I've grouped them up as best as I can (not prefect and a few things
might move around); some classes are getting too long (Controller & Draw classes) and will need further
breaking down. I feel like my UI design is too basic and simple which makes sense, although I have a CSS
class to help with this, I have not used it at all outside of putting Icons on my button because I 
have put all the time into just coding everything else, so going forward I will look to expand more on 
this.
